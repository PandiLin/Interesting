Evaluator:
    ** experiment with layer system and advice system and see which one of them 
       is more useful and flexible for the evaluator 
    ** experiment with wrapper function, and see whether it could be a good approach
       to handle side-effect
    ** the generic-evaluator should be as generic as possible, so its important to
       gracefully decouple the args and the match argument
